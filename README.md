# Content_based_wine_recommender
Recommender who uses wine reviews to recommend the next buy

For this post, I use this Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews), which contains over 100.000 wine reviews containing ratings, prices, and written descriptions. The data was scraped in 2017 from the WineEnthusiasts website.

Steps:
1. Explorative Data Analysis
2. Data Wrangling
3. Building Recommendation Engine
4. Deploying Recommendation Engine
